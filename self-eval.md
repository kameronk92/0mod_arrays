How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
So far, I feel decent about arrays. It seems like they are infinitely useful and I'm excited to expand my knowledge
Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I want to force myself to memorize all the methods. I wish I could just absorb all of them. 
What questions do you have about Arrays?
Can arrays be related? How so? Like for Turing registration, is there a cool way to return all of one students info from 10 different arrays?
